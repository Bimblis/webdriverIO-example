To see report on windows, change name of "chrome.bat.txt" file to "chrome.bat" and double click it


To see report on mac, ensure Chrome is totally closed, and execute this command in a terminal (if Chrome is already opened, the command wont do anything):

	open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files

This will open a Chrome app with permissions to open the report.
Then just open the index.html file
